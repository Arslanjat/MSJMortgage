                  A mortgage is a loan taken out from a mortgage lender to pay
                  for a property. The loan is divided into capital, i.e. the
                  amount of money you borrow to purchase the property, and a
                  mortgage interest rate, i.e. the amount the lender charges for
                  lending you the money.

                  and solicitors for business, while others work online, using

                  The amount of money depends on the amount you can comfortably
                  afford to repay each month. It will also depend on the
                  mortgage lender you choose as each has its own guidelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some mortgage lenders may only lend you a multiple of three
                  times your income while others may stretch to four, five or
                  even six times.If you are buying as a couple the mortgage
                  calculation multiples will be different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some mortgage lenders will lend you two and a half times both
                  annual incomes while others will offer three to three and a
                  half times the greater income plus one times the second
                  income.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Somehow the major factor getting your mortgage is determined
                  by the amount you earn. Lenders generally apply multiples to
                  your income to calculate your maximum loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lenders may be prepared to offer high mortgage multiples if
                  you are putting down a large deposit: because you are
                  committing more of your money to the property it represents
                  stronger security, and they may therefore be prepared to lend
                  you more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your credit history is also important in determining which
                  lenders will be prepared to lend to you, or whether they will
                  offer you their most favorable rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have consistently met your payments under current and
                  previous credit agreements you will be entitled to the more
                  competitive mortgages on the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If, however, you have failed to keep up your payments, the
                  mortgage rates available are likely to reflect this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the third important factor in determining a
                  lender&aposs decision is the property itself; the value and
                  general condition of the property will always need to be
                  assessed to ensure that it represents adequate security.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also some lenders have criteria which may rule out certain
                  property types.

                  The mortgage lender will require pay slips or other proof from
                  your employment if you are employed.If you haven&apost been in
                  business long enough to establish you can afford the mortgage,
                  a mortgage company may want three years&apos audited accounts
                  or an accountant&aposs note.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some mortgage firms are more lenient than others. An
                  independent mortgage broker can provide impartial guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mortgage repayment choicesYou can choose from three mortgage
                  repayment options:Capital payback mortgages allow loan
                  repayment over time. Your monthly payment includes interest
                  and capital repayment to pay off the mortgage at the end. This
                  repayment option guarantees mortgage payback at the end of the
                  term if all payments are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, if you choose an interest-only mortgage, your monthly
                  payment will be interest only, keeping your borrowing
                  constant. Assuming no lump sum repayments, you will still owe
                  the same amount at the conclusion of the mortgage term.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this case, you must arrange for lump sum repayments, an
                  endowment or pension plan, or the sale of the property to
                  repay the debt. This option lowers monthly costs but increases
                  your obligation and risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Part and part is the final option, where you pay interest on
                  part of the loan and capital payback on the rest. If you have
                  an endowment that won&apost cover your debt at the conclusion
                  of the term or have increased your borrowing and want to be
                  sure you&aposll pay it off, this may be right for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mortgage product pros and consYour mortgage option depends on
                  your situation and risk and cost tolerance.If security is your
                  top priority, fix your mortgage rate for an initial term so
                  your payments can reduce but not raise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main drawback of most fixed and capped rates is that if
                  you switch mortgage lenders or pay off your mortgage early,
                  you may have to pay a large early repayment charge. If you
                  want to keep your options open and safeguard future
                  flexibility, this may be a major reason to avoid them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prepayment fees...Lenders often attach early repayment charges
                  to the initial period of a mortgage, either in line with an
                  initial fixed or discounted rate or beyond it (known as
                  overhang).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you switch lenders within the mortgage offer&aposs early
                  repayment period, the lender will likely charge you. Moving or
                  paying off the mortgage may incur fees. If you want to move or
                  shop around, a mortgage product with no early repayment
                  charges is best.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, if you want to fix your monthly payment and have no
                  plans to change lenders, an early repayment charge may not
                  matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early repayment fees are usually a percentage of the sum and
                  vary by lender. We must inform you of all penalties before you
                  choose a product.

                  Not necessarily, as some mortgage companies try to be as
                  helpful as they can particularly to first time buyers.
                  Generally speaking however, it does make life easier if you

                  generally recommend the mortgage term does not extend beyond

                  because of your colour, race, ethnic or national origin, your
                  sex or if you are disabled. However, you will need to have the
                  right to reside and work in the UK for at least the duration
                  of the mortgage. Up to four people can be joined in an
                  application. At least one applicant is required to have an
                  acceptable form of income and all should have a good credit
                  history. Your application will be subject to a credit check

                  The usual term is 25 years but your loan can be for any term

                  Higher Lending Charges...Some lenders charge a one off

                  cover themselves in any case of high risk lending, which is

                  This insurance does not benefit the borrower in any way, but
                  covers the lender if, in the event of repossession, there is a
                  shortfall in repayment of the outstanding debt. Were this
                  situation to arise, the insurance company that provided the
                  policy will often pursue the borrower for the equivalent of
                  the money claimed by the lender.

                  The one off premium is usually added to the loan, rather than
                  being paid upfront at the outset, and the borrower will
                  therefore also be paying interest on this additional borrowing
                  for the life of the mortgage, unless it is paid off with a
                  lump sum or regular overpayments.

                  More and more deals are now being offered without an early
                  repayment charge; in our experience many people (particularly
                  first time buyers) are needlessly paying it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Occasionally, however, a situation could arise where the
                  advantages of a particular deal outweigh the disadvantage of
                  having to pay the premium. In this case we would clearly
                  include the fee, along with all other fees, in our
                  illustrations, and its significance would be explained to you
                  in full at the outset.

                  Lenders need expert guidance on what the property in question
                  is worth as security for them to lend on it. They instruct a
                  value to assess the property for this purpose.

                  Portable mortgages...If you decide to move home it is
                  important to know from the outset whether you have early
                  repayment charges as lenders will only charge penalties if you
                  change lender, or reduce the loan size, and not (with portable
                  mortgages) if you are actually moving to a new home. This can
                  be an important factor to take into consideration if, for
                  example, you are considering whether or not to go for a long
                  term fixed rate: you may not be sure whether you wish to move
                  or not during the initial fixed period, but as long as you
                  have a portable mortgage you will be keeping this option open.
                  Portability can still be an advantage even when your mortgage
                  product has no redemption penalties at all. For example, you
                  could have secured a particularly favorable deal originally
                  and the market could subsequently have changed, leaving no
                  comparable deals: it would obviously make sense in this
                  situation to keep the product that you have, rather than
                  switching when you move house.
