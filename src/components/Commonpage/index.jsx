      <h6 className="credit mt-10 mb-10">Sole Ownership</h6>
      <div className="credit2">
        <p>
          Sole ownernship may be described as ownership by an Individual or
          other entity capable of acquiring title. Examples of common vesting
          cases of sole ownership are:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. A Single Man or Woman, an Unmarried Man or Woman or a Widow or
            Widower:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A man or woman who is not legally married or in a domestic
          partnership.&nbsp;<em>For example: John Buyer, a single man.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            2. A Married Man or Woman as His or Her Sole and Separate Property:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A married man or woman who wishes to acquire title in his or her name
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title company insuring title will require the spouse of the
          married man or woman acquiring title to specifically disclaim or
          relinquish his or her right, title and interest to the property. This
          establishes that both spouses want title to the property to be granted
          to one spouse as that spouse&rsquo;s sole and separate property. The
          same rules will apply for same sex married couples.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example: John Buyer, a married man, as his sole and separate
            property.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            3. A Domestic Partner as His or Her Sole and Separate Property:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A domestic partner who wishes to acquire title in his or her name
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title company insuring title will require the domestic partner of
          the person acquiring title to specifically disclaim or relinquish his
          or her right, title and interest to the property. This establishes
          that both domestic partners want title to the property to be granted
          to one partner as that person&rsquo;s sole and separate
          property.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example:&nbsp;John&nbsp;Buyer, a registered domestic partner, as
            his sole and separate property.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h6 className="credit mt-10 mb-10">
        <span id="CO-OWNERSHIP" className="ez-toc-section"></span>CO-OWNERSHIP
      </h6>
      <div className="credit2 p">
        <p>
          Title to property owned by two or more persons may be vested in the
          following forms:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Community Property:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A form of vesting title to property owned together by married persons
          or by domestic partners. Community property is distinguished from
          separate property, which is property acquired before marriage or
          before a domestic partnership by separate gift or bequest, after legal
          separation, or which is agreed in writing to be owned by one spouse or
          domestic partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          In California, real property conveyed to a married person, or to a
          domestic partner is presumed to be community property, unless
          otherwise stated (i.e. property acquired as separate property by gift,
          bequest or agreement). Since all such property is owned equally, both
          parties must sign all agreements and documents transferring the
          property or using it as security for a loan. Each owner has the right
          to dispose of his/her one half of the community property by
          will.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example: Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, husband and wife, as
            community property, or Sally Smith and Jane Smith, registered
            domestic partners as community property. Another example for same
            sex couples: Sally Smith and Jane Smith, spouses, as community
            property.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Community Property with Right of Survivorship:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A form of vesting title to property owned together by spouses or by
          domestic partners. This form of holding title shares many of the
          characteristics of community property but adds the benefit of the
          right of survivorship similar to title held in joint tenancy. There
          may be tax benefits for holding title in this manner. On the death of
          an owner, the decedent&rsquo;s interest ends and the survivor owns all
          interests in the property.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example: Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, husband and wife, as
            community property with right of survivorship, or John Buyer and
            Bill Buyer, spouses, as community property with right of
            survivorship. Another example for same sex couples: Sally Smith and
            Jane Smith, registered domestic partners, as community property with
            right of survivorship.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Joint Tenancy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A form of vesting title to property owned by two or more persons, who
          may or may not be married or domestic partners, in equal interests,
          subject to the right of survivorship in the surviving joint tenant(s).
          Title must have been acquired at the same time, by the same
          conveyance, and the document must expressly declare the intention to
          create a joint tenancy estate. When a joint tenant dies, title to the
          property is automatically conveyed by operation of law to the
          surviving joint tenant(s). Therefore, joint tenancy property is not
          subject to disposition by will.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example: Bruce Buyer, a married man and George Buyer, a single
            man, as joint tenants.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If a married person enters into a joint tenancy that does not
          include their spouse, the title company insuring title may require the
          spouse of the married man or woman acquiring title to specifically
          consent to the joint tenancy. The same rules will apply for same sex
          married couples and domestic partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Tenancy in Common:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A form of vesting title to property owned by any two or more
          individuals in undivided fractional interests. These fractional
          interests may be unequal in quantity or duration and may arise at
          different times. Each tenant in common owns a share of the property,
          is entitled to a comparable portion of the income from the property
          and must bear an equivalent share of expenses. Each co-tenant may
          sell, lease or will to his/her heir that share of the property
          belonging to him/her.&nbsp;
          <em>
            For example: Bruce Buyer, a single man, as to an undivided 3/4
            interest and Penny Purchaser, a single woman, as to an undivided 1/4
            interest.
          </em>

          Other ways of vesting title include as:
        </h6>
        <div className="credit2 p">
        <p>
          <strong>1. A Corporation*:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A corporation is a legal entity, created under state law, consisting
          of one or more shareholders but regarded under law as having an
          existence and personality separate from such shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. A Partnership*:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A partnership is an association of two or more persons who can carry
          on business for profit as co-owners, as governed by the Uniform
          Partnership Act. A partnership may hold title to real property in the
          name of the partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Trustees of a Trust*:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A Trust is an arrangement whereby legal title to property is
          transferred by a grantor to a person called a trustee, to be held and
          managed by that person for the benefit of the people specified in the
          trust agreement, called the beneficiaries. A trust is generally not an
          entity that can hold title in its own name. Instead title is often
          vested in the trustee of the trust. For example: Bruce Buyer trustee
          of the Buyer Family Trust.
        </p>
     
      <p>
        <strong>4. Limited Liability Companies (LLC)*:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This form of ownership is a legal entity and is similar to both the
        corporation and the partnership. The&nbsp;<em>operating agreement</em>
        &nbsp;will determine how the LLC functions and is taxed. Like the
        corporation its existence is separate from its owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          *In cases of corporate, partnership, LLC or trust ownership &ndash;
          required documents may include corporate articles and bylaws,
          partnership agreements, LLC operating agreements and trust agreements
          and/or certificates.
