      <h5 className="credit mt-20 mb-20">The Role of Credit</h5>  
      <p className="credit2">
        Your credit report, score, and history are all major factors when it
        comes to applying for a loan, so itâ€™s important that you understand how
        credit works, and how will be analyzed. Your mortgage broker will
        analyze your credit report as soon as it is obtained, and will ensure
        that the credit report they have is in fact yours.
      </p>
  
      <p className="credit2">
        A broker will first look for any judgments against you and collection
        accounts. These will require full explanations, or may have to be paid
        down before you are eligible for a loan.
      </p>

      <p className="credit2">
        Your lender will also look at the number of recent inquiries and why, as
        this may suggest to them that you have recently applied for credit
        elsewhere and were denied. They will be comparing your debts and the
        ages of your accounts. If you incurred debt very recently, they may want
        to know what the money was used for. They will check to see if you have
        made many late payments, and when this happened. Every lender has their
        own acceptable limits for these factors so your broker will check to see
        that your accounts fall within these limits. Your broker will also
        ensure that they have a completely up-to-date credit report. This is
        because a borrower may open a new account or incur new debt, and thus
        change their financial status, if too much time elapsed between when a
        report is produced and when it is analyzed.
      </p>

      <p className="credit2">
        Finally, your credit information is your personal, private financial
        data. Your loan officer or mortgage broker should never share your
        information with any outside party, including a real estate agent or
        firm, without your express permission.
      </p>
     

     
      <h5 className="credit mt-20 mb-20">Bad Credit</h5>
      <p className="credit2" >
        Bad credit is a big issue for many borrowers, and how it is handled will
        depend primarily on the lending institution. People are capable of
        change and your lender will consider this as a possibility. Basically,
        this means they will look at how long ago your credit was negatively
        affected and compare that to your recent financial activity. If you have
        shown reasonable improvements, and have an acceptable explanation as to
        why your credit was negatively affected, it may have less of a bearing
        on your application. For instance, an old debt that shows you have more
        been making timely appropriate payments will be less likely to have a
        large impact on your overall credit worthiness.
      </p>

      <p className="credit2">
        Your lender will also look at what caused the bad credit. How did you
        get yourself into that situation and what have you done to change that?
        If the credit trouble is very recent and there is not enough information
        (or time passed) to show you have made appreciable differences in your
        borrowing behavior, you will likely not be approved for anything but a
        debt re-structuring loan.
      </p>
      <p className="credit2">
        Some lenders will accept a borrower with bad credit, but will add
        particular borrowing stipulations. Common credit stipulations include
        requiring a larger down payment, a tighter limit on debt to income or
        loan to value ratios, and requiring additional forms of collateral.
      </p>
     
   
      <h5 className="credit mt-20 mb-20 ">Discrepancies</h5>
    
      <p className="credit2">
        A professional mortgage broker will usually not provide you with a copy
        of your credit report. If you have past judgments, poor credit, or are
        worried about other potential aspects on your credit report, you are
        encouraged to contact the credit bureaus yourself to obtain your own
        copy.
      </p>
      <p className="credit2 mb-20">
        Your credit report will take precedence over your word, so if there are
        discrepancies between the debt you should have and what is shown on your
        report, you must contact the credit bureau to have these issues
        addressed. If you are unable to change the information on your credit
        report, be aware that the information will be trusted over anything you
        might tell your broker.
