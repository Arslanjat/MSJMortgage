Instead, it is provided by private lenders, such as banks or mortgage companies. Conventional loans are the most prevalent type of mortgage in the United States, and they come with various terms, including fixed or adjustable interest rates, and typically require a down payment. These loans do not carry government-backed insurance and rely on the borrower\'s creditworthiness and the lender\'s criteria."},{"id":2,"image":"/assets/img/blog/agencyjumbo.jpg","title":"Agency Jumbo","tag":"An Agency Jumbo mortgage is a type of home loan that combines features of both jumbo and agency loans. It exceeds the conforming loan limits set by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but adheres to specific criteria and guidelines set by these agencies. This hybrid loan offers favorable terms and interest rates, making it a viable option for homebuyers seeking financing beyond standard limits.

These loans adhere to the funding criteria and guidelines established by these entities. Conforming loans are advantageous for borrowers with excellent credit, offering lower interest rates. These loans play a crucial role in ensuring the availability of affordable financing for homebuyers, with limits adjusted annually. Their terms and conditions must align with the specific criteria outlined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and GSEs, promoting stability and affordability in the housing market."},{"id":4,"image":"/assets/img/blog/img-1.jpg","title":"None conforming","tag":"A Nonconforming mortgage, or jumbo mortgage, is a home loan that does not adhere to the guidelines of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These loans surpass the maximum loan amount, deviating from set standards regarding suitable properties, down payment requirements, and credit criteria. Unlike conforming loans, nonconforming mortgages offer more flexibility but often come with higher interest rates due to increased risk for lenders. Borrowers seeking larger loan amounts or not meeting typical credit and income requirements may opt for nonconforming mortgages. These loans provide an alternative for unique financial situations beyond conventional lending limits."},{"id":5,"image":"/assets/img/blog/img-1.jpg","title":"HomeReady","tag":"The HomeReady mortgage program, offered by Fannie Mae, aims to enhance homeownership accessibility for low and moderate-income borrowers. This initiative allows for a minimal down payment (as low as 3%), accepts income from non-borrower household members, mandates homeownership education, offers reduced mortgage insurance rates, and considers a reasonable credit score. HomeReady promotes inclusivity by targeting a broad range of income levels, enabling co-borrower flexibility, and encouraging financial education. It serves as a supportive option for individuals seeking affordable and flexible pathways to homeownership."},{"id":6,"image":"/assets/img/blog/img-1.jpg","title":"Refi-Possible","tag":"The Refi-Possible mortgage refers to the possibility of refinancing an existing mortgage, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. This type of mortgage allows homeowners to replace their current mortgage with a new one, potentially securing a lower interest rate. Common reasons for refinancing include seeking reduced monthly payments, shortening the loan term, obtaining cash-out for home improvements, or switching from an adjustable-rate to a fixed-rate mortgage. Refi-Possible mortgages offer homeowners financial flexibility and the opportunity to optimize their mortgage terms based on changing circumstances and market conditions."},{"id":7,"image":"/assets/img/blog/img-1.jpg","title":"ARMS","tag":"An Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage loan with an interest rate that is not fixed for the entire loan term. ARMs typically have an initial fixed period (e.g., 3, 5, 7, or 10 years) with a lower teaser rate, followed by an adjustable period where the rate fluctuates based on a specific financial index. This adjustment can occur annually or at predetermined intervals. ARMs offer lower initial rates and payments, making them attractive, especially if borrowers expect to sell or refinance before the fixed period ends. However, they carry interest rate risk, as future rate movements are unpredictable. Borrowers should carefully consider their financial situation and future plans when opting for an ARM."}]}'),l=function(){var e=(0,i.useState)(null),n=e[0],t=e[1];return(0,a.jsx)("section",{id:"faq",className:"container mt-30",children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"container col-sm-12",children:(0,a.jsx)("ul",{id:"faq-list",className:"wow fadeInUp gallery twsty",children:o.c.map((function(e,i){return(0,a.jsxs)("li",{style:{marginBottom:"10px"},children:[(0,a.jsxs)("div",{style:{display:"flex",alignItems:"center",cursor:"pointer",backgroundImage:'url("/assets/img/line-pattern1.png")'},onClick:function(){return function(e){t(n===e?null:e)}(i)},children:[(0,a.jsx)("p",{style:{display:"inline-block",fontSize:"18px",color:"#7a0404",fontWeight:"600"},children:e.title}),(0,a.jsx)("button",{className:"faq-button ml-auto",style:{fontSize:"25px"},children:n===i?(0,a.jsx)("span",{children:"-"}):(0,a.jsx)("span",{children:"+"})}),(0,a.jsx)("hr",{})]}),n===i&&(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"faq-content",children:[(0,a.jsx)("p",{style:{backgroundImage:'url("/assets/img/line-pattern.png")',fontSize:"14px",color:"#4d4c4c"},children:e.tag}),e.tag2&&(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:e.tag2}),e.tag3&&(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:e.tag3})]})]},i)}))})})})},c=function(){return i.useEffect((function(){document.querySelector("body").classList.add("index3")}),[]),(0,a.jsxs)(r.Z,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"Conventional",fullPath:[{id:1,name:"home",url:"/"},{id:2,name:"Our Product",url:"/product"}]}),(0,a.jsx)(l,{})]})}},1163:function(e,n,t){e.exports=t(387)}},function(e){e.O(0,[1664,3771,9774,2888,179],(function(){return n=4369,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
